I put my phone in airplane mode but it still didn’t fly
If you drop soap on the floor, is the soap dirty or is the floor clean
Socks are just portable blankets for your feet
Yesterday I saw a cloud wearing sunglasses
If you believe in telekinesis, raise my hand
Why does my shadow have no shoes
Bananas don’t have toes and that’s why I can’t find my wallet
If life gives you lemons, throw them back and demand chocolate
The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese
Why do we drive on a parkway and park on a driveway
